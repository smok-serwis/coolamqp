    A base class for Consumer/Publisher implementing link set up and tear down.

    A channeler can be essentially in 4 states:
    - ST_OFFLINE (.channel is None): channel is closed, object is unusable. Requires an attach() a connection
                                     that is being established, or open, or whatever. Connection will notify
                                     this channeler that it's open.
    - ST_SYNCING: channeler is opening a channel/doing some other things related to it's setup.
                  it's going to be ST_ONLINE soon, or go back to ST_OFFLINE.
                  It has, for sure, acquired a channel number.
    - ST_ONLINE:  channeler is operational. It has a channel number and has declared everything
                  it needs to.

                  on_operational(True) will be called when a transition is made TO this state.
                  on_operational(False) will be called when a transition is made FROM this state.

    - ST_OFFLINE (.channel is not None): channeler is undergoing a close. It has not yet torn down the channel,
                                         but ordering it to do anything is pointless, because it will not get done
                                         until attach() with new connection is called.

        Channeler registers this for:
            (None - socket dead)
            (BasicCancel, BasicCancelOk, ChannelCloseOk, ChannelClose)

        This method provides to send a response for ChannelClose

        This handles following situations:
        - payload is None: this means that connection has gone down hard, so our Connection object is
                           probably very dead. Transition to ST_OFFLINE (.channel is None)
        - payload is a ChannelClose: this means that a channel exception has occurred. Dispatch a ChannelCloseOk,
                                     attempt to log an exception, transition to ST_OFFLINE (.channel is None)
        - payload is a ChannelCloseOk: this means that it was us who attempted to close the channel. Return the channel
                                       to free pool, transition to ST_OFFLINE (.channel is None)

        If you need to handle something else, extend this. Take care that this DOES NOT HANDLE errors that happen
        while state is ST_SYNCING. You can expect this to handle a full channel close, therefore releasing all
        resources, so it mostly will do *the right thing*.

        If you need to do something else than just close a channel, please extend or modify as necessary.

        WARNING: THIS WILL GET CALLED TWICE.
            Once on ChannelClose - if so,
            Second with None - because socket dies.
